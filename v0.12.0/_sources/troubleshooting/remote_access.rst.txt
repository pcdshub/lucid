NoMachine
---------

When using NoMachine, some users reported issues with rendering of the screen
often with parts of the screen covered in green or black.

Here is an example of how it can look like during an issue:

.. figure:: /_static/nomachine_issue.png
   :scale: 50 %

To work around that follow the steps below:

- Go to display > change settings.
- Check all the 5 options on the bottom (See image below for reference).
- Restart your entire session.
- Now all your Qt-based screens should work properly.
