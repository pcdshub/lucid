Lucid Toolbar Configuration
===========================

``lucid`` can be launched with a toolbar file that specifies
the tabs that are displayed below the device grid.
These tabs can be configured to hold buttons
that open other screens.

   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Lucid display with the toolbar highlighted.

Invocation
----------

The invocation to include this toolbar file is:

.. code-block:: bash

    lucid --toolbar /path/to/toolbar/file.yaml HUTCHNAME

Options and Limitations
-----------------------

- The user can specify an arbitrary number of tabs.
- Each tab can have an arbitrary number of columns.
- The columns are filled from left to right, then from top to bottom.
- Only ``PyDMShellCommand`` and ``PyDMRelatedDisplayButton`` widgets are supported.
- Any available pyqt property or general python attribute can be specified on either
  of these button types.

Guidelines
----------

- The related display option (``display``) should be used whenever it is possible to do so,
  because the screen will open more quickly compared to a shell script, which will need to
  initialize an entire new python shell with new imports.

File Format
-----------

The toolbar configuration is stored in a yaml file that encodes a dictionary.
Each key in this top-level dictionary is the name of a tab to include.
These tabs will be arranged in file order from left to right.

Each of these tab names should contain another dictionary with the following top-level keys:

- ``config`` (optional)
- ``buttons``

The only ``config`` option right now is ``cols``, which defaults to 4.

Here's an example config file structure, omitting only the ``buttons`` sections:

.. code-block:: yaml

    tab1_name_with_3_cols:
      config:
        cols: 3
      buttons: see below
    tab2_name_with_2_cols:
      config:
        cols: 2
      buttons: see below
    tab3_name_with_4_cols:
      buttons: see below


The ``buttons`` key should itself point to a dictionary that maps each
button text to a button config dictionary, in order.
LUCID will iterate through these dictionaries and create buttons,
arranging them from left to right across each column before moving to the next row.

The button config dictionary has one special key: ``type``.
The ``type`` key can either be ``shell`` to create a ``PyDMShellCommand`` button,
or it can be ``display`` to create a ``PyDMRelatedDisplayButton``.
If ``type`` is omitted, or is not one of these options,
an inactive ``QPushButton`` will be created.

All other keys in the config dictionary should be mappings from qt property names
to each property's desired value.
This is forward-compatible with any new properties that may be implemented in the future
for these button types.

Here's an example buttons config snippit that shows the structure and some of the
useful properties. This will create two buttons, one with button text "Cool PyDM Display"
and another with button text "Run Neat Script."

.. code-block:: yaml

    buttons:
      Cool PyDM Display:
        type: display
        filenames:
          - /path/to/some/ui/file.ui
        macros:
          - "{'PREFIX': 'COOL'}"
      Run Neat Script:
        type: shell
        commands:
          - "echo 'neat'"
          - /path/to/some/neat/shell/script.sh
        redirectCommandOutput: true

Examples
--------

The LCLS lucid toolbar configurations are backed up in
`this github repo <https://github.com/pcdshub/lucid_config>`_.
These are all good examples for how to set these files up.
